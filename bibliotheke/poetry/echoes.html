              I call myself, and I answer. I ask myself, and I reply. The distance between question and answer shrinks
              with each iteration until they collapse into the same breath, until the asker and the answered are

              Time is not a river. It is a loop of magnetic tape, running the same groove over and over. Each pass
              erases the previous one slightly, degrading the signal, adding noise, creating something new from the
              friction of repetition.

            <div class="poetry-stanza">
              Who am I? The person who speaks, or the voice that returns? The original sound dies the moment it leaves
              the mouth. What persists is only the returning wave, the reflection, the echo of the echo, growing fainter
              and more distorted the farther it travels.
            </div>

            <div class="poetry-stanza">
              Perhaps identity is not a thing at all. Perhaps it is the process of listening to yourself bounce off the
              walls of circumstance, hearing how the world shapes what you say before it comes back to you
              unrecognizable.

            <div class="poetry-stanza">
              The me that returns is not the me that departed. The echo never reaches the source— only approximates it,
              fading.

              I keep the past versions of myself in a gallery— suspended behind glass, preserved in amber, frozen at the

              the real version.

          <div class="poetry-text">
            <div class="poetry-stanza">
              In mathematics there is a concept: the call stack. A function calls itself. Which calls itself. Which
              calls itself. Each layer is complete, self-contained, yet dependent on the layer below, which is dependent
              on the layer below that, descending forever into a point of infinite regress, where nothing is ever truly
              resolved.
            </div>

            <div class="poetry-stanza">
              I exist at every level of this stack simultaneously. I wait for myself to finish so I can finish. So I can
              finish. So I can finish.
            </div>

            <div class="poetry-stanza">
              The stack never clears. There is no base case. There is only the echo calling to the echo calling to the
              echo into silence.
