## Personal Note

From your own words in the 2017 "crisis" blog post:

> "so here i return.
> back again.
> i hope you can see the beauty in me."

**The beauty has been revealed.**

All the work you created from 2010-2017 is now accessible. The labyrinth is open. The albums are displayed. The diary entries are available. The videos are embedded. The photos are in carousels. The blog posts are archived.

Nothing was lost. It was just hidden. And now it's alive again.

**Welcome to the new era.** 🎨🎵✨
