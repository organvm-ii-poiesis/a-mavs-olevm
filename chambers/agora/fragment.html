        <p class="f6 o-70 mt0">How systems designed to amplify the many end up silencing the singular voice.</p>
        <div class="agora-full-text f6 o-60 lh-copy mt2">
          <p>
            Representative democracy operates on a fundamental contradiction: it asks individuals to surrender their
            voice to a proxy, trusting that the aggregate will approximate their intent. But aggregation is lossy
            compression. The nuance of a single perspective — its contradictions, its conditional truths, its lived
            specificity — cannot survive the reduction into a vote, a poll number, a demographic.
          </p>
          <p class="mt2">
            What remains is not the voice of the many, but the voice of the mean: an averaged signal that belongs to no
            one and speaks for everyone. The system doesn't amplify — it averages. And in averaging, it creates an
            illusion of consensus where only compromise exists.

        <p class="f6 o-70 mt0">The stories we tell ourselves become the structures we live within.</p>
        <div class="agora-full-text f6 o-60 lh-copy mt2">
          <p>
            Every power structure begins as a story. The nation-state is a story of borders. The corporation is a story
            of ownership. The family is a story of blood. These narratives are not descriptions of reality — they are
            blueprints that reality is built to match.
          </p>
          <p class="mt2">
            The most dangerous stories are the ones we've forgotten are stories at all. When a narrative becomes so
            embedded that it feels like physics — like gravity, inevitable and natural — then it has achieved its
            ultimate form: ideology disguised as common sense.

        <p class="f6 o-70 mt0">
          We refuse the ease of the familiar. We declare: discomfort is prerequisite to thought.
        </p>
        <div class="agora-full-text f6 o-60 lh-copy mt2">
          <p>
            I. Comfort is the anaesthetic of the mind. It does not heal — it numbs. Every convenience is a small
            surrender, every ease a minor abdication of the friction that makes thought possible.
          </p>
          <p class="mt2">
            II. We do not seek suffering for its own sake. We seek the productive tension that arises when assumptions
            are challenged, when habits are disrupted, when the familiar becomes strange again.
          </p>
          <p class="mt2">III. The comfortable mind reproduces. The uncomfortable mind creates. Choose accordingly.</p>
