# A-MAVS-OLEVM stewardship inventory and order of battle

Evidence date: 2026-09-13. The initial inventory was READ-ONLY and made no remote changes. The execution workstreams own source/runtime proof and final integration; the publication supplement below records subsequently opened successor issues. This report supports execution, not a claim the complete program has shipped.

## Orientation (8 lines)

1. Canonical repository: organvm-ii-poiesis/a-mavs-olevm, stable ID 924834822.
2. Purpose: evolved ETCETER4 artistic site connecting art, sound and words with navigable chambers and generative/interactive works.
3. Original historical website has a distinct preservation/restoration edition; this repository expands the practice.
4. Default main surveyed head: 477d62305943049f638be8fd46d74bd89f4d582f, dated 2026-08-26.
5. Green requires honest provenance and reproducible lint/format/lock/HTML/unit/browser/accessibility/build checks plus working deployment paths.
6. Root baseline: validation passes/66 warnings; unit 1,222 tests/40 suites pass; targeted HTML 0 errors/5 warnings; audit 10 vulnerabilities, 7 high/3 moderate.
7. Done means a releasable edition fulfills its declared scope; lifelong evolution and future recordings remain open.
8. AGENTS read; BRANCHES.md and docs/branches.md absent. Existing practice is GitHub Flow with main, preserved captures and independent gh-pages; no develop.

## Completeness and rights

- Branch pages: 16 then empty page2. All-state PR pages: 89 then empty page2. Open PRs 8, merged39, closed-unmerged42.
- Open issue collection: 9 records comprising 8 PRs and actual issue #94. Full issue metadata retained.
- All open PR metadata, reviews, issue comments, inline comments and exact-head checks were fetched; each collection was below100/page. Closed/live #103 also fully inspected.
- Every live nondefault branch and all42 closed-unmerged PR heads were compared against the fixed main SHA. Ahead counts measure ancestry, not semantic uniqueness after squash.
- All33 branch-main Actions runs and all40 exact-SHA check runs successful. These prove security, automation, release drafting and Pages checks, not application tests.
- Exact-main Pages build/deploy succeeded 2026-08-26 under historical master: [run32966727557](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/a-mavs-olevm/actions/runs/32966727557). Served-content/browser verification remains separate.
- Application ci-cd.yml already lists main+master. Public REST workflow listing proves CI/CD Pipeline ID184284863 is disabled_manually since2026-03-04T17:19:03; Project Board Automation ID229586162 also disabled_manually that minute. Other9 workflows active. Recover the disable intention before enabling the repaired pipeline; workflows.json records the evidence.
- Repo metadata reports admin/maintain/push/triage/pull true. main protected=true; detail read denied403 by integration. Rulesets[]. Required checks/reviewers unknown; do not bypass.
- Labels/milestones/discussions collection endpoints unsupported in connector fetch. Public REST fallback confirmed37 labels and0 milestones (no pagination Link headers), saved labels.json/milestones.json. Public Discussions page returned a welcome/empty landing with no discussion links, but ancillary loading errors and default Open filter prevent claiming all historical discussions absent. Issue-attached metadata is retained.
- No remote branch, issue, PR, review, workflow, protection, tag or deployment mutated by inventory agent.

gh-pages has no common ancestor with main: independent generated publication history, not a source branch to merge. No standing program lanes, releases or hotfix refs exist. Preservation refs form one custody family with distinct residue; #102/#103/#104 form one coverage family.

- #100 is 4 commits ahead/16 behind, 248 changed files and conflicts. Gallery/data/ingest/studies intention remains valid; auto-seeded “227 real works” is not artist-confirmed identity or consent. Comments retain navigation, curation, performance/access and deployment obligations.
- #104 is 1 ahead/16 behind and conflicts with #102's merged suite. Four unresolved P1s: undefined scrollIntoView spy, wrong cleared-query result, evaluated-class binding, wrong navigation-global stub.
- #103 is closed with live branch, 1 ahead/16 behind and11 unresolved findings. Preserve unique cases; its closure is not evidence they were integrated.
- #131 requests Vitest5; its release notes require Node22/Vite6.4 while current CI specifies Node20. Establish a compatible runtime contract before treating this as a safe patch upgrade.

Draft/HTTP200 alone insufficient. |

Opening claim of no public URL/deployment is stale as a blanket description: metadata declares Pages and successful exact-head deployment exists. Releases list only unpublished draft v0.0.1, with no assets. #94 was historically auto-closed then reopened; current stale workflow only labels. Preserve it as activation lineage, correct claims with live proof.

## D — Hidden work, remote evidence

- etceter4-revival:10 unique commits, last2026-07-04,246 changed files from merge base; existing reconstruction/edition work must be recovered before creating another restoration.
- May preservation pair:22 document moves plus agent-instruction edits. July capture: evolution prototypes (cinematic/editorial/signal), broad SVG formatting and destructive test/metadata differences. Extract intended work; do not merge snapshot wholesale.
- limen/discover PR#105 merged but branch ahead by ancestry; compare DISCOVERY.md/value-repos.json content before calling residue unique.
- #102/#103/#104 generated competing suites for one path; repair the family/assertion/mock contract.
- #100 contains generated catalogue/studies and old URL/Instagram assumptions; old1221-test claim is historical, not current evidence.
- No open draft PRs. Draft releasev0.0.1 is unpublished and has no assets.
- Application CI evidence missing because CI/CD Pipeline is disabled_manually (workflow184284863); state-read evidence in workflows.json. Trigger already main+master. Preserve/recover reason for the manual disable while repairing the verification rail.
- Source TODO/FIXME and workflow/instruction drift scan: hidden-source.txt, root owns mapping and runtime proof.
- Unpushed worktrees on unavailable hosts and Discussions inventory remain unknown, not empty.

## Verdict cards

### E-VERIFY — Honest releasable foundation

Members:main/application CI/audit/#94/steward instructions/closure automation.
Intention evidence:user requires Verify→Heal first; #94 requests “versioned publish/release target + tag-based artifact automation.”
Root cause:metadata/security checks do not prove app behavior; current audit/remote acceptance unfinished.
Status:needs-heal. Finish:compatible audited toolchain; exact-SHA application tests/build/browser/accessibility; safe steward/branch/closure rules; deployment provenance.
Next:root foundation branch fixes demonstrable failures/closure-before-evidence, proves locally then PR.
Abandonment risk:false-green default or unsafe closure/merges. Close/delete allowed:NO while finish unmet.

### E-DEPS — Compatible reproducible dependency maintenance

Members:open#122/#128–132 and40 closed-unmerged dependency attempts.
Evidence:requested parser4.2.7/brace1.1.18/fast-uri3.1.7/humanfs0.16.8/vitest5/js-yaml4.3.2; repeating old titles encode same upkeep.
Root cause:overlapping lock edits, repeated versions, missing app checks, unresolved vulnerable tree.
Status:needs-heal; major-update compatibility blocked until proven.
Finish:one successor preserves applicable fixes/no downgrades, coherent Node/test contract, clear audit scope, all supported installs/build/tests green.
Next:trace paths, reconcile package fixes on one successor; validate Vitest5/runtime contract separately within that family if not presently compatible.
Risk:unfixed vulnerabilities or broken runtime. Close/delete:NO until successor green on default, each member linked and unique residue accounted.

### E-COVERAGE — Discovery behavior coverage

Members:merged#102,closed/live#103,open/live#104/shared DiscoveryController suite.
Evidence:“focused, PASSING test suite”; July comments and15 review findings show initialization/mock/assertion defects.
Root cause:repeated generator starts from old default without reconciling tests or browser-global semantics.
Status:needs-heal.
Finish:one suite preserving meaningful unique cases, safe globals/shims/teardown, honest assertions; each finding dispositioned against current code.
Next:compare all3 suites, heal #104 or residue-preserving successor, full unit and relevant browser proof.
Risk:search/modal/navigation regressions, failures before assertions. Close/delete:NO before verified default integration.

### E-VISUAL — Public front door and catalogue

Members:#100/feat-visual-home/related revival.
Evidence:#100 “image-first front door + data-driven works gallery”; preserve labyrinth.
Root cause:branch drift plus generated identity/publication data mixed with navigation changes.
Status:needs-heal.
Finish:reconciled gallery/routes/assets; stable work/edition IDs; valid media/provenance, truthful destinations, mobile/desktop/deep-link/accessibility proof.
Next:reconcile existing #100 on healed main; retain original authored labels, distinguish source records from confirmed works.
Risk:inaccessible or misleading public entry; lost existing implementation. Close/delete:NO before preserved intention ships.

### E-REVIVAL — Historical and restored editions

Members:etceter4-revival plus explicitly authorized original-repo source.
Evidence:tip “derive archive image manifest stems”; user wants original restored and evolved repo expanded.
Root cause:historical snapshot, runtime restoration and evolved work lack explicit edition/provenance boundaries.
Status:active, dependent on foundation/historical comparison.
Finish:immutable historical source, functional restoration with documented deviations/smoke, evolved links preserve prior identity.
Next:compare existing10-commit revival to2017 original; salvage usable work.
Risk:reconstruction churn, erased era behavior, false fidelity. Close/delete:NO until scoped edition finish verified on default.

### E-CAPTURE — Preservation and prototype residue

Members:capture/master-deferred and both wip/preserve refs.
Evidence:messages “coalesce default preservation”, “move22 docs to docs/”, “working-tree edits”.
Root cause:broad captured edits have no integrated per-intention disposition and include conflicting deletions.
Status:parked pending extraction; refs kept.
Finish:path-level residue ledger; relevant prototypes/docs/instructions integrated without undoing healed code/tests.
Next:extract3 evolution prototypes and unique docs/config after foundation; do not wholesale merge.
Risk:lost author/experimental work. Close/delete:NO absent full residue mapping and verdict.

### E-DISCOVER — Discoverability metadata

Members:merged#105/live discover branch.
Evidence:DISCOVERY.md/value-repos additions.
Root cause:retained branch after possibly squash-equivalent integration.
Status:active verification.
Finish:content-equivalence check or salvaged residue.
Next:compare both files to main. Risk:low if preserved. Close/delete:NO until equivalence proved and retirement justified.

### E-AGENT — Historical assistant configuration

Members:closed#9/related merged#14/#15/#16.
Evidence:#9 agent setup, current main agent files.
Root cause:historical chained integration means ancestry alone cannot show missing capability.
Status:parked pending semantic comparison.
Finish:useful live rules incorporated by stewardship baseline without obsolete workflow revival.
Next:compare changed files to current configuration. Risk:lost conventions/contradictory instructions.
Close/delete:NO new deletions; historical PR remains evidence.

## Proposed branch constitution

Existing main stays production trunk; gh-pages retains generated publication history. Calibrated proposed recurring lanes:lane/verify-heal for proof and repair;lane/editions for evolved album, text, manuscript and audiovisual editions. Historical restoration stays in the original repository. BRANCHES.md is the constitution; no lane/evolve is currently justified. Do not claim lanes exist until created. Short-lived fix branches can target main; no redundant lane/heal merely for symmetry, no develop/release lane inferred.

One intention per work/<lane>/<intent> or feat/fix/chore/docs/test/hotfix branch, one worktree each; normal PRs to target lane/main; lanes stay near main without rewriting others' history. Only tested deploy artifacts enter gh-pages. Captures are custody refs, not integration lanes. Dormancy documented, retirement by evidence/successor/constitution PR. No secrets/unrelated WIP/unsupported public claims.

## First concrete actions / illogical items

Root has installed and tested current default and prepares foundation/stewardship implementation; execution begins Wave0 then Wave1. Inventory made no remote mutations.

No artwork or intention is inherently illogical. Evidenced unsafe actions:blindly merging conflicting#100/#104; importing capture test deletions; calling auto-generated source entries artist-confirmed works; Vitest5 under unchanged Node20 CI; metadata-only success treated as application proof; deleting custody branches by age. Preserve intentions and repair those conditions.

Raw evidence:remote-inventory.json; remote-supplement.json; closed-unmerged-comparisons.json; review-threads.json; hidden-source.txt. The public-safe closed-PR comparison inventory accompanies this report; working raw evidence is not a published media source index.

## Publication supplement — governance successor

This report is included in the governance work for issue #134, independently of
maintenance successor #133. The initial inventory remains the baseline of 16
branches, 89 PRs, 8 open PRs and issue #94; #133 and #134 were opened after that
read-only pass and must not be silently included in its counts.

- #133: dependency/runtime family successor, `needs-heal`; the six original
  open maintenance PRs remain preserved until default verification and no-loss
  verdicts.
- #134: steward protocol, constitution, complete inventory/edition plan and tested
  merge-receipt behavior; local candidate tests pass, remote adoption and enabled
  metadata enforcement remain open.
- Application CI/CD Pipeline ID184284863 and Project Board Automation ID229586162
  report `disabled_manually`; no rationale was recovered. Existing identities are
  retained. No settings or disabled-state workaround is part of this PR.
- The new Stewardship Protocol workflow tests the new policy code. It does not
  replace the disabled application suite or reinstate write automation. Its own
  existence is not a claim of observed execution or protected required status.
- Branch protection detail remains inaccessible (403). No main push, merge,
  issue closure, branch deletion, protection change, or deployment is performed
  by this governance publication.
- Full closed-unmerged comparison inventory: `closed-unmerged-2026-09-13.json`.
- Cross-repository separation and artistic edition plan: `EDITION-EXECUTION-PLAN-2026-09-13.md`.

The complete returned milestone collection is empty. No label or milestone was
changed by this publication.

### Partial branch-protection evidence refreshed before publication

The normal branch metadata endpoint now exposes `protected=true` and a partial
required-status summary: enforcement level `non_admins`, context
`validate-dependencies`, and `app_id: null`. The dedicated protection endpoint
still returns 403; reviewer counts, strictness and the complete policy remain
unverified. This partial record does not establish application or stewardship
checks as protected requirements, and no setting was changed.
